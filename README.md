# medicalchatbot
The Medical Chatbot is a Python-based AI assistant that provides basic medical guidance using TinyLlama LLM for conversational responses and a CSV dataset for symptom-condition mapping. It helps users identify possible conditions based on symptoms, offers general health advice, and suggests when to seek professional care but it is not a substitute for professional medical consultation.
